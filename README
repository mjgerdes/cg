CG Game Server is an extensible WebSock based game server/client framework.

CG provides

 - a websock server (based on SimpleWebsocketServer)
 - a type safe, fast, extensible and easy to use client/server messaging system (based on Google's protocol buffers)
 - a batteries-included, lightweight and easy-to-extent database layer (based on ODB)
 - fast, simple and powerful scripting (based on Lua)
 - purely browser based client code (based on HTML and Javascript)

CG is still in a very early stage of development! Check back again in the future :-)

Installation
=========
Building CG requires several prerequisites. You should
 - make sure you have boost libraries version 1.54 or higher installed and in your library and include path
 - have protoc, the google protocol buffer compiler installed and
 - have the libprotobuf libraries installed
 - have libssl installed.
 - have other fun dependencies installed! The CMake system and the compiler will guide you :)



Installing ODB
----------

You can get sources from the ODB website. Alternatively, on Ubuntu you may use this PPA at your own risk.

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/paulbovbel/ppa/ubuntu trusty main 
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/paulbovbel/ppa/ubuntu trusty main 

Then install the following packages:

$ sudo apt-get install libodb-mysql-2.4 libodb-2.4 libodb-mysql-dev libodb-dev

You also need the ODB compiler (odb), which has to be built from source.

To use a database (mysql by default), you of course need one installed, including development libraries. For mysql, you can do:

$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev

Building CG
==========
To build, make sure you are in the top level directory of cg. Then do

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ../
$ make

You will end up with a 'cgserver' executable.
