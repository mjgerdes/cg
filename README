CG Game Server is an extensible WebSock based game server/client framework.

CG provides

 - a websock server (based on SimpleWebsocketServer)
 - a type safe, fast, extensible and easy to use client/server messaging system (based on Google's protocol buffers)
 - a batteries-included, lightweight and easy-to-extent database layer (based on ODB)
 - fast, simple and powerful scripting (based on Lua)
 - purely browser based client code (based on HTML and Javascript)

CG is still in a very early stage of development! Check back again in the future :-)
